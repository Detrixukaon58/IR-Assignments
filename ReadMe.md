This is **Important** 

You must go to `src/pf_localisation/src/laser_trace/`  and run 
``` $ ./compile.sh ```

This will make sure that you have the correct `laser_trace.so` file in the `src/pf_localisation/src/pf_localisation` directory.

I've compiled mine for arch and added it to the .gitignore
