This is **Important** 

In order to clone this repo for this branch, run ``` 
``` 
$ git clone git@github.com:Detrixukaon58/IR-Assignments.git --branch arch pf_localisation
```



You must go to `src/pf_localisation/src/laser_trace/`  and run 
```console
$ ./compile.sh 
```

This will make sure that you have the correct `laser_trace.so` file in the `src/pf_localisation/src/pf_localisation` directory.

I've compiled mine for arch and added it to the .gitignore
